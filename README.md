This was the first game that I made in unity. You can move around the map and shoot at enemies, thats about it. There are also items in the maps that you were supposed to be able to pick up, but for some reason that doesn't work now lol, I didn't bother to check why.

# Usage
- WASD for movement
- space to jump
- hold shift to speed up
- E to throw a grenade
- There are two guns you can switch between them using 1 and 2 keys
